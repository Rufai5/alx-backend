# [ WHAT IS FLASK - BABEL?]()
 Flask-Babel is an extension for the Flask web framework that provide
s internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support for you
r Flask applications. It helps you make your web applications accessi
ble and user-friendly for people from different linguistic and cultur
al backgrounds.
# [Here's what you can do with Flask-Babel:]()
1. Internationalization (i18n): With Flask-Babel, you can mark string
s in your application's code as translatable. These strings are then
extracted and can be translated into different languages. This allows
 your application to support multiple languages without having to wri
te separate code for each language.
2. Localization (l10n): Once your strings are marked as translatable,
 Flask-Babel provides tools to generate translated versions of your a
pplication in different languages. This includes generating language-
specific templates, date and time formatting, and more.
3. Language Switching: Flask-Babel enables you to provide language sw
itching functionality in your application, allowing users to choose t
heir preferred language.
# [To use Flask-Babel in your Flask application, you would typically
follow these steps:] ()
Install the Flask-Babel extension using pip.
Initialize the extension in your Flask app.
Mark strings in your code that need to be translated using the gettex
t function.
Use the babel command-line tool to extract translatable strings from
your code.
Translate the extracted strings using .po files for each language.
Compile the translated .po files to .mo files.
Configure your Flask app to use the appropriate language based on use
r preferences.
Overall, Flask-Babel makes it easier to create applications that can
be used by people around the world, regardless of their native langua
ge.
# [Application:] ()
  Flask-Babel is commonly used in Flask applications to add internati
onalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) features. Here are some ke
y applications of Flask-Babel in a Flask web application:
# [Multi-Language Support:] ()
 The primary use of Flask-Babel is to enable your Flask application t
o support multiple languages. Users can switch between languages, and
 the application can display content in the user's preferred language
. This is essential for reaching a global audience.
# [Translating Text:] ()
 You can mark text strings in your templates and application code as
translatable using the gettext function provided by Flask-Babel. This
 allows you to separate translatable content from your codebase.
# [Generating Translations:] ()
 Flask-Babel provides tools to extract translatable strings from your
 code and generate .po files. Translators can then use these files to
 provide translations for each supported language.
# [Date and Time Formatting:] ()
 Flask-Babel helps you format dates, times, and numbers according to
the conventions of the user's selected language and region. This ensu
res that your application's output is culturally appropriate.
# [Pluralization:] ()
 Different languages have different rules for pluralization. Flask-Ba
bel handles pluralization rules, allowing you to correctly display co
ntent that varies based on quantity.
# [Language Switching:]()
 You can implement a language switcher in your application's user int
erface, allowing users to easily switch between supported languages.
# [Localization of Templates:] ()
 Flask-Babel supports translating the content of your templates, maki
ng it easy to provide language-specific versions of your user interfa
ce.
# [Currency Formatting:] ()
 If your application deals with currency, Flask-Babel can format curr
ency values according to the user's locale.
#[Translation Context:] ()
 Sometimes, a single word may have different meanings in different co
ntexts. Flask-Babel allows you to provide context to translators to e
nsure accurate translations.
# [Unit and Measurement Conversions:] ()
 If your application involves units and measurements, Flask-Babel can
 help with formatting and converting them based on the user's locale.
By using Flask-Babel, you can make your Flask application more access
ible to users from various language backgrounds, improve the user exp
erience, and create a more inclusive and global application.

# [Learning Objectives] ()
 /******************************************************************
Learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languag
es
Learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user s
ettings or request headers
Learn how to localize timestamps
#[ Requirements] ()
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using
 python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandat
ory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env pyt
hon3
All your *.py files should be executable
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__imp
ort__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__imp
ort__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions and methods should have a documentation (python3 -
c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c
 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining
 what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it
will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
